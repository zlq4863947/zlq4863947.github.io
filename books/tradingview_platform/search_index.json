concept that market movement is psychological in nature and is driven by supply and demand, support and resistance, and momentum and exhaustion.\nSince a price chart is graphical representation of just two variables, price and time,  DecisionBar  attempts to clarify what those two variable are telling you, as opposed to obscuring that information with complex mathematical formulas.  DecisionBar  works by keeping track of what the market you are trading has done in the past, and then alerting you when trading opportunities based on that movement occur in real-time.\nDecisionBar  can be adjusted to limit signals and whipsaws in volatile markets, alert you to trend changes in trending markets, as well as to give frequent signals for traders who use a \"scalping\" style of trading.\nDecisionBar  includes a BiasBar and Risk Oscillator to help you determine if a signaled trade is in sync with the market, and a Trailing Stop Module, based on Average True Range, to help you manage you trades as well as lock in profits.\nThe Trailing Stop Module can be set to tighten your stops when a preset profit threshold is reached, as well as adjust dynamically to changes in volatility, tightening your stops quicker if volatility decreases, and slower if volatility increases.\nDecisionBar  can be used on Bar and Candlestick charts and well as Renko and Heiken-Ashi charts. DecisionBar does not work on Point and Figure and Kagi charts. Please see the example of  DecisionBar  applied to TradingView charts below. The meaning of each signal is explained in the DecisionBar Trading Manual, but for the purposes of this discussion, all you have to know is that Green signals are Buy signals and Red signals are Sell signals.\nDecisionBarManual.pdf\n\nThe chart above shows DecisionBar applied to a Candlestick chart in TradingView.\n\nThe chart above shows DecisionBar applied to a  Renko chart  in TradingView.\n\nThe chart above shows DecisionBar applied to a Heiken-Ashi chart in TradingView.\n"},"book/01/Jurik_Research.html":{"url":"book/01/Jurik_Research.html","title":"01-2、Jurik Research","keywords":"","body":"Jurik Research\n目录\n\nJURIK RESEARCH\nJMA\nRSX\nVEL\nCFB\nDMX\n\nJURIK_RESEARCH\nJurik Research  has gained the reputation of the most reliable, precise and smooth indicators. Ideally, you would like a filtered signal to be both smooth and lag-free. Lag causes delays in your trades, and increasing lag in your indicators typically result in lower profits.\nJMA\nInvestors, banks and institutions worldwide ask for the Jurik Research Moving Average (JMA). You may apply it just as you would any other popular moving average. However, JMA's improved timing and smoothness will astound you.\n\nRSX\nThe popular RSI indicator simultaneously measures trend velocity and quality. RSI gives a strong signal when a trend is fast and clean. However, RSI is a jittery signal, making technical analysis very difficult. Jurik's RSX is vastly superior. The chart compares the classic RSI to Jurik's RSX.\n\nVEL\nThe classical momentum indicator is a simple yet effective measure of market direction. Typical attempts to remove noise by applying a moving average will seriously degrade its usefulness by adding lag. Jurik Research solved this problem with an advanced momentum oscillator that produces very smooth curves.\n\nCFB\nSerious analysts are now adjusting the speed of their indicators to the duration of market trend. If this idea appeals to you, you need a tool that measures price trend duration, not cycle length. Jurik Research discovered, back in 1996, how fractals could readily assess the duration of market trend. The new indicator, called CFB (Composite Fractal Behavior), works well whether or not the price time series has any cycle components.\n\nDMX\nDMX is the ultra-smooth, low lag version of your classic DMI indicator. With DMX on your charts, you can throw away both DMI and ADX. The classic indicator ADX is a smoothed (and lagging) version of the more basic, and more noisy, DMI indicator. DMI itself is composed of two jittery components, DMI.up and DMI.down, combined the following way: DMI=| DMI.up - DMI.down | / | DMI.up + DMI.down |\n\n"},"book/01/Key_Hidden_Levels.html":{"url":"book/01/Key_Hidden_Levels.html","title":"01-3、Key Hidden Levels","keywords":"","body":"Key Hidden Levels\nIndicator package in the  TradingView AppStore  –  Key Hidden Levels.\n\nIt includes the following indicators:\n\nEarnings Price Support;\nOptions Price Support;\nRange Movement;\nUDIO Bars.\n\nThe  Tim West  Studies are designed to help you see key hidden levels in a stock chart so you are more prepared to assess where it might go in the future. The levels are fundamental to how markets work and relate to 16 important “battle” dates each year out of more than 250 bars to confuse you. We take the relevant days and make them stand out. Which days? The 4 days a year that companies report EARNINGS and the 12 monthly options expiration days. With the power of TradingView, you can now view graphs of these important dates, with a proprietary twist, that allows you to see where buyers or sellers may still be lurking long after the earnings report is forgotten by the average traders.

These MTF panes include often-used indicators - RSI, Williams %R, Moving Averages and Squeeze - making them indispensable for either long term play or for scalping.\nFor squeeze, both COG squeeze and BB/KC squeeze panes are included. The ability to mark the price bars with squeeze on all timeframes (user selectable) makes trading break-outs and options easy and more rewarding.\nS/R Levels\n\nSupport/Resistance Levels package  includes 7 indicators. These automatically derive S/R price areas from the underlying indicators and show them overlaid on price. These include S/R Levels derived from indicators like RSI, CCI, %B and Williams %R.\nBy visually laying out S/R Levels on chart, these allow complex S/R clusters to be identified and used correctly.

For example, \"Alert me if Apple crosses $150 up\".  All users can get visual popups, audio signals, email alerts and email-to-sms alerts. A Premium plan holder can additionally get real-time server side text message (SMS) alerts, delivered directly to his / her phone..\nHere’s a wonderful sneak peek from Chris Moody about the new alerts (view full screen for full HD resolution).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alerts menu can be seen on the right panel. Open it, go to the chart and create first alert:\n\nCreating alerts\nThere are several ways to set an alert:\n\nThe button  on top toolbar:\n\n\nThe button  in alerts manager window:\n\n\nFrom the  right-click menu:\n\n\nThe button  on drawing panel:\n\n\nThe tab in properties window  of a drawing object:\n\n\nThe \"plus\" button  next to current price on price scale:\n\n\nThe button  in the chart title:\n\nAlerts can be created for  data series,  indicator plots  and  drawing objects. Alerts on data series no depend on the time intervals, alerts for studies depend on the interval because it’s taken into account when calculating indicators.\nNOTE!  If the indicator parameter is changed  after the alert is created, then alert will be triggered using  the old settings.\nThat video by Chris Moody teaches how to create a custom script based on non series studies for the alerts.\nAlerts Functions\nWhen you create an alert, the following settings are available:\n\nTrigger Condition, which determines when the alert appears.  \nFrequency  - you can set whether an alert will be triggered only once or multiple times.  \nTimer  which will automatically stop the alert. Alert will be automatically turned off when the Timer expiration setting is reached.  \nMessage  that will be shown when the alert is triggered.\n\nAlerts Actions\nThe following options are available to you, so that you can be notified about your alerts as soon as they are generated:\n\nShow Popup  - a pop-up message will appear once an alert is triggered. If this option is enabled, a pop-up message will appear, even if you are browsing in another tab (for this feature to work properly, please allow TradingView to show desktop notifications).  \nPlay Sound  - once an alert is triggered, you will hear a sound.  \nSend Email  - an email will be sent to you, when an alert is triggered. We will use the email address in your TradingView profile.  \nSend Email-to-SMS  - use this option to receive notifications on your phone. Email-to-sms is the easiest and absolutely free way to send text message (SMS) from the internet to phones.  This site  aims to be the most complete and up-to-date list of email addresses that can be used to send text messages to phones.  \nSend SMS  - this is a premium feature that allows you to receive SMS directly to your phone, once an alert is triggered. Please note that alerts are sent as a single SMS. Your message will be shortened if it exceeds the SMS character limit. There is a monthly limit of 500 SMS.\n\nAlerts for drawings\nAlerts are available for the following drawings:  \nConfigure the alerts here:-Drawing settings panel:-Drawing properties:-Right-clicking the drawing:  \nIf a drawing has an active alert, you’ll see an icon next to the drawing (same color as the drawing).\nIf the alert is inactive, the icon becomes gray.  \nIf the drawing is changed, the alert is automatically adjusted.\nNote: Drawing alerts depend on the chart resolution, just like the indicator alerts.\nALERTS TYPES\nCrossing\nThe most basic and widely used alert. Basically means, “let me know when price crosses X”. “Crossing” alert is triggered when the current price series crosses the value set when the alert was created (doesn’t matter which direction).\nUsage example:  \"I want to know when Google goes up by $10 from the current price\". There are a couple of things you can do. Open a chart of GOOGL, and open the Alert menu, and the current price will be filled in the price box (right now it's 97.40). Choose Crossing and change it manually to 107.40. That's it!\nAlternatively, you can right-click the chart where it says $107.40 and choose Set Alert. The 107.40 price will be filled in automatically.\nCrossing Down / Crossing Up\nA more specific version of the Crossing alert. You get to specify whether a price is crossed in an upward move, or a downward move. This is useful when\n\"Crossing Down\" alert is triggered when the current series crosses downwards the value set in the alert, and \"Crossing Up\" is for alerting when price crosses the value upwards.\nUsage example:  \"Microsoft is currently at 44.54. I think it will go down, and then back up to $42, at which point I'll buy because it's an upward trend. So, I want to know when MSFT crosses $42 UPWARD.\" So, open a chart of MSFT, and choose Crossing Up alert type and type in 42.\nGreater Than / Less Than\nThis alert is for when you want to know that price didn’t just bump into a level you set, but actually surpassed it.\n\"Greater Than\" alert is triggered if the price series reaches a value that is higher than the one set in the alert. Respectively, \"Less Than\" alert is triggered if the series reached a value lower than the one set in the alert.\nUsage example:  \"Apple now is at $97.79 and approaching the psychlogically difficult price of $100. It's likely AAPL price will bounce off $100 a few times, but once it's through, I think it'll continue to rise steadily. Therefore, I'd like to know once the $100 barrier is bypassed for good.\" So, you open the AAPL chart and set the alert to Greater Than $100 for AAPL, and once the price is GREATER THAN $100, you’ll be alerted.\nEntering Channel / Exiting Channel\nChannels are defined boundaries above and below a certain price. Usually channels define the \"typical\" random volatility of price for a stock, and a move across channel borders can be seen as a significant or an out-of-the-ordinary move by the price.\n\"Entering Channel\" alert is triggered when the series enters the channel that was defined when the alert was created. \"Exiting Channel\", logically, is triggered when the series exits the channel.\nChannel boundaries can be defined by the series or levels (or their combination). These alerts us the position of the previous bar relative to the channel.\nUsage example:  \"By looking at the historical price chart, Cisco's price roughly fluctuates about $2 after each earnings and then jumps. It's at $25.86 right now. Next earning are coming up soon, and I'd like to see if price moves out of the +$2 or -$2 channel from what it is now\".\nSo, set the Exiting Channel alert with the +2 and -2 relative to the current price, and you'll be alerted.\nInside Channel / Outside Channel\n\"Inside Channel\" alert is triggered if the series value is within the channel and \"Outside Channel\" alert when the series value is out of the channel. The value should be set when creating the alert.\nThese alerts, unlike Entering Channel/Exiting Channel alerts, don't take into account the position of the previous bar relative to the channel.\nUsage example:  This one is very similar to the Entering / Exiting Channel, but rather lets you know if the value is inside or outside the defined channel.\nMoving Up / Moving Down\nThis is the Crossing Up / Crossing Down alert with one additional parameter - time. You can get alerted if the stock goes up by $X within a certain amount of time (i.e. bars).\n\"Moving Up\" alert is triggered if the price goes up by a certain value that you set in the alert (within a pre-specified number of bars). \"Moving Down\" alert does the same thing, but when the price goes down.\nUsage example:  \"I want to know if Google goes up by $10 within the next 4 days, I don’t care after that.\" So, you open a chart of GOOGL, and set each bar to equal 1 day. Open the Alert menu, and the current price will be filled in the price box (right now it’s 97.40). Choose Moving Up and change it manually to 107.40, and set the number of bars to 4 (since you wanted 4 days and each bar is set to 1 day). All done!\nMoving Up % / Moving Down %\n\"Moving Up %\" alert is the same as above, but in percent. It's triggered if the price goes up by a certain percentage, which you set in the alert.  The specified amount of bars.  Moving Down alert - when the price goes down for the set percent.\nUsage example:  Same thing as Moving Up / Down but in percent. You don't have to calculate the target value in your head, you can simply choose UP 10% for example, and if the current price is $97.40, the target will automatically be set at $97.40 x 1.1 = $107.14\nCustom Alert Conditions\nYou can create custom alert conditions in Pine studies. Read more:  https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Alerts_in_pine\nMANAGE ALERTS\nIn  Manage Alerts  you can browse and edit your alerts.\nAlerts  sorting  functionality was added for your convenience.\nUse control keys in the list to  stop, resume, edit or delete alerts.\nDouble-click  an alert to open its Edit menu.Move the cursor to the status tooltip and to see the reason of an alert stop:  \n\nan active alert has a green dot and the \"Active\" status.  \na triggered alert with \"Only once\" setting has an orange dot and a \"Triggered and Not Active\" status.  \na manually disabled or expired alert has a red dot and a \"Manual Stopped\" or an \"Expirated\" status.\n\nWidget  located in the chart legend will show how many alerts were created for this symbol on this resolution.\nAfter creating an alert a  mark specifying its level  (except Moving alerts) will appear on the chart. Hover your cursor over the mark to see a tooltip with a description.\nDouble-click the mark to see the Alert Edit menu. Right-click the mark to add or delete an extended alert line. You can also edit the alert value by simply dragging the label. Just move it to the desired place on the chart and the new value will be automatically applied in the Edit dialog window. When the alert is triggered, the corresponding label will be start blinking on the chart.\nAll triggered alerts are automatically added into  Alerts Log  and you can access alerts history anytime.\n"},"book/03/Add.html":{"url":"book/03/Add.html","title":"03-1、Add","keywords":"","body":"Add\nAPPLICATION\nThe add function allows users to overlay additional symbols or data series over top of the existing chart. This is different than the  compare  function in that the chart does not change the vertical axis from price to percentage and auto-scale to fit both. The vertical axis stays aligned with the chart's original data series. The new symbol/data series is merely overlaid on top. This allows for the actual price value of both data series to be visible without the chart collapsing if the values are too far apart. The add function is good for visual comparisons between two or more symbols.\nThe example below is an example of a chart containing the EURUSD and the EURJPY.\n\n\n\nA popular reason for using the add function is the ability to compare market trends for several similar or related instruments simultaneously. For example, analyzing two different gold tracking ETFs to spot minor differences.\nThe example below is a chart containing two separate gold tracking ETFs. They are obviously quite closely related but careful examination shows that minor differences do occur.\n\n\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\nTo add a new symbol to overlay on top of the current data series/chart, simply click on the \"Add\" button on the toolbar along the top of the chart and type the symbol into the dialogue box and click the + sign.\n\nAnother option is the \"Overlay the main chart\" feature. If this is unchecked, the new symbol will not be overlaid on top of the original data series, it will be sent to a new panel beneath the original one. This allows for greater control of each data series even though it can hinder direct, visual comparisons.\n\n"},"book/03/Add_my.html":{"url":"book/03/Add_my.html","title":"03-2、Add/my","keywords":"","body":"Add/my\nAPPLIKASI\nFungsi tambah membantu pengguna meletakkan simbol atau siri data tambahan pada carta. Fungsi ini adalah lain daripada fungsi perbandingan di mana carta tidak akan menukarkkan paksi menegak daripada harga ke peratusan. Paksi menegak akan sentiasa selaras dengan siri data asal carta. Siri data atau simbol baru hanya akan diletak di atas carta, jadi nilai harga asal untuk kedua-dua siri data masih boleh dinampak walaupun nilai sangat berbeza. Fungsi tambah adalah sangat berkesan untuk perbandingan antara dua atau simbol yang lebih.\nCarta bawah merupakan contoh carta yang mengandungi EURUSD dan EURJPY.\n\n\n\nFungsi tambah selalu digunakan sebab ia dapat membandingkan trend pasaran tunuk beberapa alat yang mirip dan berkaitan pada masa yang sama. Contohnya, ia dapat menganalisis dua ETF emas berlainan untuk mengenalpastikan perbezaan yang kecil.\nContoh bawah merupakan carta yang mengandungi dua ETF emas yang berlainan. Anda dapat melihatkan mereka hampir sama namun masih terdapat perbezaan jika anda melihat dengan teliti.\n\n\nBAGAIMANA MENGGUNAKANNYA DI TRADINGVIEW\nUntuk meletakkan simbol pada siri data atau carta semasa, anda hanya perlu klikkan butang \"Add\" di toolbar dan taipkan simbol di kotak dialog dan klikkan tanda +.\n\nPilihan lain merupakan fungsi \"Overlay the main chart\". Jika ia tidak ditandakan, simbol baru tidak akan diletakkan di siri data original dan ia akan dihantar ke panel bawah siri data original. Namun pilihan ini akan menjejaskan perbandingan visual terus.\n"},"book/03/Compare.html":{"url":"book/03/Compare.html","title":"03-3、Compare","keywords":"","body":"Compare\nAPPLICATION\nThe compare function tool is used to compare the market movements of two or more different symbols simultaneously. Comparing multiple symbols simultaneously is done for a couple of reasons. For example, it is an easy way to visualize market health as a whole. This could be accomplished by pulling up an SPY (which tracks the S&P 500) and adding the DIA (Tracks the Dow) and QQQ (Tracks the Nasdaq) symbols. The result is one single chart containing easy to read, pertinent information spanning the entire market.\nThe example below is an example of a chart containing the SPY, DIA and QQQ.\n\n\n\nAnother popular use for a comparison chart is comparing two companies within the same sector. For example, in the chart below, there is a comparison between two automobile companies; General Motors and Ford. This is he same theory as the above example, but it narrows the snapshot down to a single sector instead of the whole market.\n\n\nIt is important to note, that when you add a symbol to a chart, the vertical axis will change from price to percentage. The percentage shown is the price movement for whatever period is currently visible on the chart. This is absolutely necessary. If you switch it back to price, the chart will collapse unless the price values of the symbols are very close to each other. Below is an example of a Google and Apple comparison chart when switched back to price. Their prices are about $500 apart. Therefore when you switch to price, both data series flatten out and the chart loses its effectiveness\n\n\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\nTo add a comparison to your current data series/chart, simply click on the \"Compare\" button on the toolbar along the top of the chart and enter a symbol. Several popular symbols are already listed which can be checked in order to be added to the chart. Any symbol can be added however. If you would like a symbol that is not on the default list, just type the symbol into the dialogue box and click the + sign.\n\n"},"book/03/Compare_my.html":{"url":"book/03/Compare_my.html","title":"03-4、Compare/my","keywords":"","body":"Compare\nAPPLIKASI\nAlat perbandingan digunakan untuk bandingkan pergerakan dua atau lebih simbol di pasaran. Terdapat beberapa sebab kita bandingkan beberapa simbol pada masa sama. Contohnya, ia dapat menggambarkan pasaran dengan lebih senang. Ia dapat dicapaikan dengan menggunakan SPY (yang mengikut S&P 500) dan tambahkan simbol DIA (yang mengikuti Dow) dan SPY (yang mengikuti Nasdaq). Akhirnya satu carta yang senang dibaca dan mengandungi maklumat yang meliputi semua pasaran akan dihasilkan.\nCarta bawah merupakan contoh carta yang mengandungi SPY, DIA dan QQQ.\n\n\n\nAnda perlu ingat bahawa selepas anda menambah satu simbol ke carta, paksi menegak akan bertukar daripada harga ke peratusan. Peratusan yang ditunjukkan merupakan pergerakan harga untuk tempoh tertentu pada carta. Ia adalah sangat penting. Jika anda tukar balik ke harga, carta akan runtuh melainkan jika nilai harga simbol adalah hampir sama. Carta bawah merupakan contoh carta perbandingan Google dan Apple apabila bertukar balik ke harga. Harga mereka adalah kira-kira $500 beza. Jadi, apabila anda bertukar ke harga, data mereka akan menjadi rata dan carta sudah tidak berkesan lagi.\n\n\nBAGAIMANA MENGGUNAKANNYA DI TRADINGVIEW\nUntuk menggunakan perbandingan untuk carta anda, anda hanya perlu klikkan butang \"Compare\" di toolbar dan masukkan simbol. Beberapa simbol yang sedia ada dan popular dapat ditambahkan pada carta. Namun, sebenarnya semua simbol juga boleh ditambahkan. Jika anda perlu tambahkan simbol yang tidak disenaraikan, anda cuma perlu taipkan simbol pada kotak dialog dan klikkan tanda +.\n\n"},"book/03/Events.html":{"url":"book/03/Events.html","title":"03-5、Events","keywords":"","body":"Events\nEVENTS ON CHART\nTradingView has major economic events right to your charts:\n\nAs you know, we have added option to show most important events on FOREX, BitCoin and CFD charts.

These scaling options will affect not only how the chart is displayed but also how it will look when moving forward. Here is a rundown of the different options within the scaling options window.\nSCALING OPTIONS WINDOW\n\nReset Scale\nWill reset the scale back to its center point. After making several modifications to the look and/or scale of the chart, clicking this option will re-align everything back to its initial state.\nShow Left Axis\nWill show the vertical axis on the left-hand side of the chart. A left-oriented axis and a right-oriented axis can be visible simultaneously.\nShow Right Axis\nWill show the vertical axis on the right-hand side of the chart. A left-oriented axis and a right-oriented axis can be visible simultaneously.\n\n\n\nThis chart is an example of having both the right axis and left axis visible simultaneously.\n\nAuto Scale\nAllow the axis to scale automatically along with any price movements. This way, the data series will always be visible with only the axis changing accordingly.\nLock Scale\nLocking the scale is very different from allowing the axis to auto scale. When \"lock scale\" is active, the axis will stay frozen the way it is when it is initially locked. This means that the scale (price intervals) wont change along with price movements. It is therefore possible that if the data series moves high or low enough, it could move out of view of the chart window.\nScale Series Only\nThis option is for when there are studies or indicators overlaid onto the main chart window. When this option is active, the axis will scale according to the data series (price) alone. The values and coordinates of any active indicators will not be factored into the scaling of the axis. Keep in mind that they may cause parts of any indicators to not be visible within the chart.\n*Below is an example of a chart with the \"Scale Series Only\" option selected. As a result, portions of the Bollinger Bands indicator are off screen.\n\n\n\nPercentage\nThis option will change the vertical axis display from price to percentage. The percentage shown is the amount price has changed within the current view. The calculation starts at the first visible bar and continues from there.\n\nBelow is an example of two charts showing the exact same data. However, the first chart is showing the data using price along its axis while the bottom chart is showing percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\nLog Scale\nThis option will change the vertical axis from a standard linear scale to a logarithmic scale. Logarithmic scales use intervals that correspond to orders of magnitude rather than intervals that are equidistant from each other. Essentially using a log scale is appropriate when viewing data that covers a very wide range. Using logarithmic values instead of actual values can reduce the wide range of data into a more manageable size.\n"},"book/03/Study_Templates.html":{"url":"book/03/Study_Templates.html","title":"03-8、Study Templates","keywords":"","body":"Study Templates\nAPPLICATION\nStudy templates are a very useful feature of tradingview charts.

First, there is a \"U\" shaped chart pattern which is considered \"The Cup\". The Cup is followed by a slight consolidation or downtrend which forms \"The Handle.\" The pattern is considered to be a bullish continuation pattern. Therefore, once price breaks above the handle, a significance advance in price would be expected.\nKey aspects of the Cup and Handle Pattern\n\nTrend:  Because the Cup and Handle is ultimately a continuation pattern, it should be preceded by an uptrend. Typically this trend would be around a few months old.\nCup:  The cup should be a \"U\" shape with valid support levels at the bottom. Be careful to avoid a cup that is a \"V\" shape. A \"V\" shape is considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. Ideally, both sides of the cup would be equal heights. However, this is fairly uncommon. Much like any pattern, it is rare for all aspects to line up with exact precision.\nCup Depth:  Remember, the cup shape is a retracement of a previous advance. The depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, because of volatile conditions and variables, the depth can really be a range of 1/3 to 2/3 retracements of the previous advance.\nHandle:  After the formation of the right side of the cup, the handle is formed. The handle can sometimes resemble a flag or pennant that slopes downward. It can also be a simple, short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before price breaks out. Typically, the handle should be no more than a 1/3 retracement of the cup's advance. Keep in mind that the smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation. It may also be a good idea to wait for a break above the resistance line established by the highs of the cup.\nVolume:  Volume should follow along rather closely with the shape of the cup as it is being formed. For example, volume will typically be on the decline as the left side of the cup forms amid falling prices. Along the bottom or base of the cup formation, volume will typically remain lower than average. Once price begins to rise, forming the right side of the cup, volume should significantly increase.\nDuration:  The duration of the pattern can vary greatly. For example, the cup can extend from 1 to 6 months (and sometimes longer). The handle would ideally last for 1-4 weeks but in some cases can be longer.\n\n"},"book/04/Double_Tops_and_Bottoms.html":{"url":"book/04/Double_Tops_and_Bottoms.html","title":"04-3、Double Tops and Bottoms","keywords":"","body":"Double Tops and Bottoms\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR\nThe Double Top and Double Bottom are actually two separate formations which are both considered to be reversal patterns. The Double Top is a bearish reversal while the Double Bottom is a bullish reversal. In the case of a Double Top, the pattern is characterized by two consecutive peaks at roughly the same price point. The peaks are separated by a moderate trough. The Double Bottom formation is essentially the exact opposite. It is characterized by two consecutive troughs at roughly the same price point. The troughs are separated by a moderate peak.\nIn a Double Top setup, when price comes back down from the second peak and breaks through the support line created by the lowest point of the trough, a reversal of the previous trend is signaled. Of course in a Double Bottom setup, once price rises after the second trough and breaks through resistance created by the center peak's formation, a reversal is considered to be at hand.\nKey aspects of Double Tops and Bottoms Patterns\n\nTrend:  Because Double Tops and Double Bottoms are reversal patterns, they must be preceded by a well defined trend in order to be considered valid. A Double Top would be preceded by a bullish trend, while a Double Bottom will be preceded by a bearish trend.\nFirst Peak/Trough:  The first peak is simply the high point of the current bullish trend in a Double Top. The first trough would be the low point of the current bearish trend.\nTrough/Peak:  The trough is formed by a subsequent drop in price after the first peak. This drop is typically a 10-20% drop. Likewise, in a Double Bottom, the peak is a 10-20% rise in price after the first trough.\nSecond Peak/Trough:  The second peak is formed when prices rises after the low of the trough. Price will rise and test resistance which is created by the high of the first peak. With a Double Bottom, the second trough is formed when price falls after the high of the center peak. Price will fall and test support which is created by the low point of the first trough.\nBreak:  When price bounces off of the second peak it is not necessarily a sign that the formation is complete. Price must fall below the lowest point of the trough. The bottom of the trough now signifies a key support level. In the Double Bottom formation, price must break through the resistance created by the high of the center peak. The high of the peak now signifies a level of resistance.\nSupport and Resistance:  In the Double Top, once price falls and breaks through the support of the trough and the formation is confirmed, that support now becomes a level of resistance. With the Double Bottom, the resistance created by the middle peak, now becomes a level of support.\nDuration:\n\n"},"book/04/Flag_and_Pennant.html":{"url":"book/04/Flag_and_Pennant.html","title":"04-4、Flag and Pennant","keywords":"","body":"Flag and Pennant\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR\nThe Flag and Pennant is considered a continuation pattern. It is preceded by a sharp advance or a sharp decline. The Flag and Pennant is a small consolidation that occurs before the original advance or decline continues. The Flagpole is the distance from the first resistance or support break to the high or low of the flag/pennant. The Flag itself is a small rectangle that slopes away from the overall trend. A Pennant can also be formed instead of a Flag. A Pennant is a small symmetrical triangle that begins wide and converges to a point as the pattern develops. Typically, there is little or no slope to the Pennant. Price movements will usually stay within the converging trend lines which form the triangle. Generally speaking the Flag and Pennant formation usually occurs about half way through the duration of the larger, overall trend. Once price breaks out of the Flag or Pennant, the original trend should continue.\nKey aspects of the Flag and Pennant Pattern\n\nTrend:  Because the Flag and Pennant is a continuation pattern it will be preceded by a well defined trend either bullish or bearish.\nFlagpole:  The flagpole is the distance from the first resistance or support break to the high or low of the flag/pennant. The sharp advance (or decline) that forms the flagpole should break a trend line or resistance/support level. A line extending up from this break to the high of the flag/pennant forms the flagpole.\nFlag:  The Flag itself is a small rectangle that slopes away from the overall trend.

Flag and Pennant definitely leans more towards the shorter term. Most people believe that the formation of the pattern should be between 1 and 4 weeks. Anything between 4 and 12 weeks would have more mixed results. A formation that lasts longer than 12 weeks would not be valid.\nBreak:  For a bullish formation, a break above resistance indicates that the previous advance has resumed. For a bearish formation, a break below support indicates that the previous decline has resumed.\nVolume:  Volume should be heavy during the formation of the flagpole.

There is also a horizontal line which creates the base for the three shapes. The line is known as the neckline. This pattern can be both  bullish  as well as  bearish. The head & Shoulders Pattern is a reversal pattern. Therefore once price advances either above or below the neckline, it indicates the beginning of a new trend.\nKey aspects of the Head and Shoulders Pattern\n\nTrend:  The Head & Shoulders Pattern is a reversal pattern. Therefore the formation should be preceded by a well defined trend. The completion of the pattern will then mark the beginning of a new trend in the opposite direction.\nLeft Shoulder:  The left shoulder forms at the end of an extensive advance in price. The move generally occurs during a period of high volume. After the move up (peak), price declines to an extent to form a valley.\nHead:  The Head is then formed after the valley at the end of the Left Should formation. From the valley formed at the end of the left shoulder's formation, price then rises once again to a level that is higher than the peak of the left shoulder. This move is accompanied by either normal or high volume. Then, just like the left shoulder, price then reacts and falls again on low volume. The valley should be right around the same level as the previous valley formed at the end of the formation of the left shoulder.\nRight Shoulder:  The right shoulder then begins formation after the Head and resulting valley. The right shoulder in general is formed on lower volume than both the left shoulder and the head. The key aspect of the right shoulder is that its peak must be lower than the peak of the head.\nBreak:  Now that the Head & Shoulders pattern has been formed, all that's left is price confirmation. If price proceeds to fall below the neckline, this is considered to be confirmation of the bearish setup. In a bullish setup, price breaking above the neckline would be considered confirmation.\n\n"},"book/05/Kagi_Charts.html":{"url":"book/05/Kagi_Charts.html","title":"05-1、Kagi Charts","keywords":"","body":"Kagi Charts\n目录\n\nDEFINITION\nLINE TYPES\nLINE CALCULATION METHODS\nUSES OF KAGI CHARTS\nKAGI CHART SPECIFIC OPTIONS IN TRADINGVIEW\n\nDEFINITION\nKagi Charts are a type of chart composed of vertical lines (green for up and red for down) and small horizontal lines connecting them. Similar to  Renko Charts, Kagi Charts do not factor in time. Time intervals are completely cast aside as Kagi Charts only take price action into consideration. The word Kagi is derived from the Japanese art of woodblock printing. A \"Kagi\" or \"Key\" was an L-Shaped guide used to properly align the paper for printing. Because of this, Kagi Charts are even sometimes referred to as \"Key\" Charts. The premise of Kagi Charts is fairly simple. Essentially, from the starting point (usually the first closing price) lines are drawn solely based on price action. The \"Up\" Lines (also called the yang line) are formed during  uptrends, while \"Down\" Lines (yin lines) are formed during  downtrends.\n\n\nAs long as prices continue to move in the current direction, the current up line or current down line will continue. Once price reverses enough (the necessary reversal amount is set by the trader), a horizontal line is drawn and then a line is drawn in the opposite direction of the previous line, stopping at the new closing price.\nLINE TYPES\nThere are five different types of lines that can be drawn within a Kagi Chart.\n\nUp Lines (Yang Lines)  - Form during an  uptrend.\nDown Lines (Yin Lines)  - Form during a  downtrend.\nProjected Up Lines  - During an intraday timeframe, a potential up line that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).\nProjected Down Lines  - During an intraday timeframe, a potential down line that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).\nHorizontal Lines  - Lines drawn when a line changes direction. When an up line changes to a down line, the horizontal line is considered a shoulder. When a down line changes to an up line, the horizontal line is called a waist.\n\nLINE CALCULATION METHODS\nTradingView Kagi Charts use absolute values to determine line reversals. A price movement in the direction opposite of the current line, \nthat exceeds the user defined reversal value, will cause a horizontal shoulder or waist to form along with a new line. \nThe upside to using absolute values is that it is very straightforward and it is easy to anticipate when and where new lines will form. \nThe downside is that selecting the correct reversal value for a specific instrument will take some experimentation.\nUSES OF KAGI CHARTS\nKagi Charts are a popular charting choice because of their ease of interpretation. Because they do not take time intervals into consideration at all, they have a way of factoring out the associated  noise. When price movement is the only  variable  that matters, the creation of new lines gains importance. Price movements typically need to be substantial to register a line change and therefore should always be noted. Natural, small price variations that occur naturally over time can therefore be disregarded. Some common, everyday applications for Kagi Charts are the basic line reversals  trading signal,  support and resistance  discovery and a sequence based reversal pattern.\nUp Line/Down Line Reversals - Steve Nison, who brought popularity to Kagi Charts, offered the most basic interpretation of the charts.

Line Break Charts are constructed of a series of up bars and down bars (referred to as lines) . Obviously up lines represent rising prices, while down lines represent falling prices. The key to using Line Break Charts is the user defined Number of Line setting. A Line Break Chart takes the current closing price and compares it to the closing price of a previous line. The most common Number of Line setting is 3. What this means is that the closing price of the current line is compared to the closing price of the line 2  period's  ago. If the current price is higher it is an up line and if it is lower, it is a down line. If the current closing price is the same or the move in the opposite direction is not large enough to warrant a reversal then no new line is drawn.\n\n\nLINE TYPES\nThere are only four types of lines\n\nUp Lines  - Form during an  uptrend.\nDown Lines  - Form during a  downtrend.\nProjected Up Lines  - During an intraday timeframe, a potential up line that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).\nProjected Down Lines  - During an intraday timeframe, a potential down line that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).\n\nLINE CALCULATION METHOD\nEach new closing price has three possible outcomes\n\nNew Line, Same Color - When price extends in the same direction.\nNew Line, Different Color - When the price change is large enough to warrant a reversal.\nNo New Line - When price does not change or the reversal is not large enough to warrant a new line.\n\nThe user defines the Number of Line value. The current close is then compared to a previous line close. If 3 is the user-defined value\nthen the current close is compared to the close 2 lines ago (the current line plus the 2 previous lines makes the total 3).\nThe appropriate line is then drawn (or not drawn) based on the above guidelines.\nUSES OF LINE BREAK CHARTS\nVery much like  Kagi Charts  and  Renko Charts, Line Break Charts are popular because of the way that they filter out  noise  and make price movements easy to digest and understand. Some of the typical uses of Line Break Charts are; finding  support and resistance, spotting  breakouts, and discovering classic  chart patterns.\nSupport and Resistance - Line Break Charts oftentimes reveal areas of support and resistance.\n\n\nBreakouts – Breakouts occur when bars begin to generate in a defined direction after a period of trading within a support and resistance bound trading range.\n\n\nClassic Chart Patterns - Charts that filter out time and only focus on price, such as Line Break Charts, classical chart patterns can often be spotted.\n\n\nLINE BREAK CHART SPECIFIC OPTIONS IN TRADINGVIEW\n\nUp Bars  – Change the Color and Outline of Up Bars\nDown Bars  - Change the Color and Outline of Down Bars\nProjected Up Bars  - Change the Color and Outline of Projected Up Bars\nProjected Down Bars  - Change the Color and Outline of Projected Down Bars\n"},"book/05/Point_and_Figure_PnF_Charts.html":{"url":"book/05/Point_and_Figure_PnF_Charts.html","title":"05-3、Pointand_Figure(PnF)_Charts","keywords":"","body":"Point and Figure (PnF) Charts\n目录\n\nDEFINITION\nBOX TYPES\nBOX CALCULATION METHODS\nUSES OF POINT AND FIGURE CHARTS\nPOINT AND FIGURE CHARTS SPECIFIC OPTIONS IN TRADINGVIEW\n\nDEFINITION\nPoint and Figure Charts (PnF) are another example of a chart type that relies solely on price movements and not time intervals during the creation of the chart. In this way, PnF Charts are similar to  Renko,  Kagi  and  Line Break Charts. A basic understanding of PnF Charts is that they are comprised of a series of columns made from either X's or O's. X columns represent rising prices, while columns consisting of O's denote falling prices. Point and Figure Charts were originally popular in the early 1900's before the prominence of computer based charting. They were a way for  technical analysts  to chart large amounts of data in a short period of time. With the rise of computers, PnF Charts fell out of favor for quite a while. However recently, PnF Charts are once again gaining in popularity. Overall, there is a renewed interest in \"noise  filtering\" charts which focus on price movements alone.\n\n\nThe X's and O's that make up each column occupy a space called the \"Box Size\". The box size is a user determined value. When price moves enough in the same direction as the current column, a new X or O is added to that column. When price closes far enough away in the opposite direction, a new column begins with either an X or an O (The opposite of the previous column). The amount that price must move is determined by the reversal distance. This value is created by multiplying the box size by another user defined value, the \"Reversal Amount\". The reversal amount is the number of bricks price must move in order for a new letter to be drawn or a new column to be created. Therefore if the box size is set to 1 ($1) and the reversal amount is set to 3, then price must move $3 in order for a new letter to be added to the chart.\nThere are two rules regarding the letters and columns.\n\nEach column has to be either X's or O's. There can never be two different letters in the same column.\nX columns and O columns will always alternate. You will never see two X columns side by side and vice versa.\n\nBOX TYPES\nThere are four different types of lines that can be drawn within a PnF Chart.\n\nUp Bars  - Form during an  uptrend.\nDown Bars  - Form during a  downtrend.\nProjected Up Bars  - During an intraday timeframe, a potential up line that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).\nProjected Down Bars  - During an intraday timeframe, a potential down line that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).\n\nBOX CALCULATION METHODS\nThere are two different method for reversal distance to be calculated:\n\nAverage True Range (ATR) – Uses the values generated by the Average True Range (ATR) indicator. The ATR is used to filter out the normal noise or \n  volatility of a financial instrument. The ATR method “automatically” determines a good reversal distance. \n  It calculates what the ATR value would be in a regular candlestick chart and then makes this value the reversal distance.\n\nTraditional – Uses a user-pre-defined absolute value for the box size and reversal amount. New boxes are only created when price movement \n  is larger than the pre-determined reversal amount. The upside to this method is that it is very straightforward and \n  it is easy to anticipate when and where new boxes will form. The downside is that selecting the correct box size for \n  a specific instrument will take some experimentation.\n\n\nUSES OF POINT AND FIGURE CHARTS\nAs with the other, previously mentioned \"noise filtering\" charts, Point and Figure Charts are gaining in popularity because they do not factor in time or minor, naturally occurring price movements. Propenents of these types of charts believe that this characteristic makes it easier to spot trends and anticipate future price movements. For example, Point and Figure charts are great for visualizing  trend lines,  support and resistance  levels and  breakouts.\nTrend Lines - Point and Figure Charts were originally drawn by hand on graph paper. Because of their nature, 45 degree(ish) trend lines can form naturally. These are a good way to identify the overall trend which can be beneficial on its own as well as with additional tools or indicators.\n\n\nSupport and Resistance Levels – Frequently, when using Point and Figure Charts, trading ranges appear when bars are generated between levels of support and resistance.\n\n\nBreakouts – Breakouts occur when boxes begin to generate in a defined direction after a period of trading within a support and resistance bound trading range.\n\n\nPOINT AND FIGURE CHARTS SPECIFIC OPTIONS IN TRADINGVIEW\n\nUp Bars  – Change the Color and Outline of Up Bars\nDown Bars  - Change the Color and Outline of Down Bars\nProjected Up Bars  - Change the Color and Outline of Projected Up Bars\nProjected Down Bars  - Change the Color and Outline of Projected Down Bars\nSource  - Determines what data from each period will be used in calculations.

The word renko is derived from the Japanese word “renga” which means “bricks”. Not so coincidentally, renko charts are constructed from a series of bricks whose creation is determined by fluctuations in price. The concept of renko bars is very straightforward. First, the size of the bricks is pre-determined by the user. Once price moves more than the user defined “brick size” either above or below the most recent brick, a new brick is added to the chart.\n\n\nIt is important to note that new bricks are only added when price movements completely “fill” the predetermined “brick size”. Prices may exceed the values of the previous brick (either above or below), however a new brick will not be formed until the price movement is large enough. For example, let’s say the brick size is set to 2 points and the last brick covers prices of $52 to $54. The new brick won’t be formed until prices close either at or above $56 or at or below $50. If price closes above $56, for example $57; the new brick must still stop at $56.\nThere are two rules regarding brick placement:\n\nBricks will always have their corners touching.\nThere can never be more than one brick in any one vertical column.\n\nBRICK TYPES\nThere are four different types of bricks generated by a tradingview.com renko chart.\n\nUp Bricks  – Bricks that forms above the previous brick.\nDown Bricks  – Bricks that form below the previous brick\nProjection Up Bricks  – During an intraday timeframe, a potential up brick that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).\nProjection Down Bricks  – During an intraday timeframe, a potential down brick that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).\n\nBRICK CALCULATION METHODS\nThere are two different method for bricks to be calculated:\n\nAverage True Range (ATR) – Uses the values generated by the Average True Range (ATR) indicator.

Trading using spreads has been gaining in popularity because they provide a new perspective of a financial instrument's value and can also help to alleviate some risk. There are a few different ways to utilize a spread chart. Some of the more popular ones are; price inversions, currency conversions, financial instrument comparisons and pairs trading.\nOPERATORS AND SETUP\nTo create your own custom spread chart in TradingView;\n\nEnter the first variable (symbol, number etc.) in the symbol entry window in the upper left hand corner and follow it with a space.\nEnter one of four operators; (-) for subtraction, (+) for addition, (*) for multiplication or (/) for division and follow it with a space.\nEnter the second variable (symbol, number etc.) in the symbol entry window in the upper left hand corner and press the enter key.\n\nFor Example: Entering  AAPL / XAUUSD  will create a comparison of Apple vs. Gold by dividing Apple prices by Gold prices.\nSpreads for intraday charts are calculated by taking the Open, High, Low, and Close of each 1-minute bar and then recompiled into the selected interval. This approach is the only one that results in correct spread charts. We handle all necessary calculations on our servers and display the finished spread chart in your browser.\nCOMMON SPREAD TYPES\nChart Inversions\nInverting a chart is a good way to visually chart the  correlation  between two instruments. For example, with two instruments with very low correlation, inverting one of the instruments with this method will make them viewable moving in the same direction.\nFor example an inversion on the EURUSD: 1/EURUSD\n\n\nCurrency Conversions\nMultiplying or dividing an instrument by a currency pair will allow you to view the price of the instrument in a different currency.\nFor Example Best Buy shown in Euros: BBY/EURUSD\n\n\nInstrument Comparisons\nA common way to utilize spreads is to divide one instrument by another. This will give you spread value that can be tracked like a single instrument.\nFor Example Apple vs. Gold: AAPL/XAUUSD\n\n\nExchange Arbitrage\nSpreads can also be used to view the difference in price between the same instrument traded on two different exchanges. You will need to subtract the symbol for one exchange from the symbol from another exchange.\nFor Example: BATS:FB-NASDAQ:FB\nBitcoin Arbitrage\nWith the rise in popularity of Bitcoins, arbitrage between BTC trading in different currencies has also become a popular trading opportunity.\nFor Example: BTCUSD-BTCEUR*EURUSD\n\n\nPAIRS TRADING\nPairs trading involves trading two separate instruments simultaneously in order to execute a single trade. Pairs trading is a popular way to alleviate some of the risk of trading. The idea is that you find two highly correlated symbols (or two very lowly correlated symbols) and enter a position in both symbols. If the pair is highly  correlated, they should move in the same direction. Typically, an opportunity presents itself when the pair ratio breaks through a threshold that is a certain number of standard deviations away from their average standard deviation. You would then, go long in the symbol that is under-performing and short in the symbol that is over-performing. When the pair moves back towards its average deviation, you would then close out both positions. Many technical analysts use the Bollinger Bands indicator to spot pairs trading opportunities. In example below, Bollinger Bands are set to be 2.2 Standard Deviations away from the average.\n\n\nIt is important to note a number things in regards to pairs trading.\n1.  A pairs trade is designed to be market neutral. This means that because of the positions that you take in two separate instruments, the direction of the market will not effect the position. The trade is designed to profit from the relationship between the two instruments, not the direction of the market itself.\n2.Correlation moves along a scale of -1 to 1 with 1 meaning the instruments are perfectly correlated. Keep in mind that pairs trades can also work with pairs that are extremely negatively correlated (close to -1). When setting up a pairs trade with negatively correlated instruments, you would want to enter the positions when the two contracts are closer together than usual with the anticipation that they will move apart in opposite directions. In this case, you would enter positions in the same direction for both instead of going long in one and short in the other.\n3.Another important piece of the puzzle is position size. The whole idea is to be market neutral. Therefore, you would not simply enter the same number of shares or contracts for each instrument. You would want to create the same actual dollar value in both positions. If you strictly use an equal number of shares on both sides and the dollar value of the two instruments are wildly different, then the side with the higher dollar value will have way too much weight in the trade.\nYou will notice in the below example, that simply using the same number of shares for both instruments will result in an extremely unbalanced trade in terms of dollar value.\n\nThe number of shares should be modified in order to get the dollar values as close of possible. It will rarely (if ever) be exact but getting as close as possible is important.\n\n4.The key to pairs trading is the correlation between the two instruments. One thing that many traders fail to realize is that the correlation between instruments is ever changing. Even during the course of a trade, their correlation can change. This is why correlation is important to always monitor when in a pairs trade. The trader should be prepared to exit any trades which have drastic changes and correlation.\n"},"book/06/1/Cyclic_Lines.html":{"url":"book/06/1/Cyclic_Lines.html","title":"01、Cyclic Lines","keywords":"","body":"Cyclic Lines\n目录\n\n1、APPLICATION\n2、HOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\n2.1、Style\n2.1.1、Lines\n\n\n2.2、Coordinates\n2.2.1、Price 1\n2.2.2、Price 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPLICATION\nCyclic Lines allow the user to set two vertical lines a specified distance apart.

Values between 0 and 1 are internal retracement levels. Values greater than 1 are external retracement levels while values less than 0 are extensions. A checkbox is available for each defined level which allows that level to be turned on or off for display purposes.\nThe main use of these levels is that they act as levels of  support and/or resistance  when price is retracing back from an original advance or decline. These are key levels to take note of when price is correcting or experiencing a counter-trend bounce. The idea is that after an initial move (either a decline or an advance), price will often retrace back towards the direction it came from. The areas or levels defined by the retracement values can give the analyst a better idea about future price movements. Remember that as price moves, levels that were once considered to be resistance can switch to being support levels.

A Speed Resistance Fan consists of a trend line on which speed resistance lines are drawn above (which represent time) and below (which represent price). These lines are drawn based on time/price percentages of the distance between the beginning and end of the trend line. The most common speed line percentages used by analysts are one-third and two-thirds. Fibonacci Ratios are frequently used.\nSpeed lines are a combination of  trend line  and percentage retracement analysis. Speed resistance lines not only help to measure trend corrections (percentage retracement) but also measure the speed of a trend.\nSpeed Resistance Fan lines can also be viewed as support or resistance lines. In an  uptrend, price usually stays above the higher speed line. If this line is penetrated, prices generally fall to the lower speed line, which in many cases becomes the support level. However, if prices break below the higher speed line, fall to the lower speed line, and then begin to rise, the lower speed line becomes the resistance level. In a  downtrend, the breaking of a lower speedline indicates a possible rise or rally to a higher line. If a breakout occurs above that line, the rally may continue to the top of the prior trend (or the underlying trend line).\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\n\nNavigate to  https://www.tradingview.com/\nOn the landing page, enter a symbol and click \"Launch Chart\"\nDrawing Tools are located along the left hand side of the chart.

These lines are placed according to the Fibonacci sequence. The main function of the Fibonacci Time Zone tool is to forecast or anticipate potential  reversals  based on elapsed time.\nThe first few Fibonacci numbers create relatively tight Fibonacci Time Zones at the beginning of the chart. Because of this it may be necessary to ignore the first few zones. After the first few zones, the zones expand quickly and allows some breathing room as the sequence unfolds. The basic theory behind Fib Time Zones is that potential reversal points can be found by looking ahead to the starting point of new zones.\nFibonacci Time Zone parameters are defined by the Fibonacci Sequence. Starting with 0 and 1, each number is the sum of the two prior numbers (1+2=3, 2+3=5, 5+8=13 8+13=21 etc…).\n\n\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\n\nNavigate to  https://www.tradingview.com/\nOn the landing page, enter a symbol and click \"Launch Chart\"\nDrawing Tools are located along the left hand side of the chart.

Gann around 1935. A Gann fan is comprised of a series of nine diagonal lines called Gann angles. These angles are drawn over a price chart, designed to show different  support and resistance  levels of a financial instrument.\nEach Gann angle (which extends indefinitely) divides time and price into proportionate parts. The most noteworthy Gann angle is the 1x1 or the 45° angle. According to Gann the 1x1 angle represents one unit of price for one unit of time. The idea behind the 1x1 line is that it is a perfect 45° which ascends 1 point every 1 day. There are additional important angles such as the 2x1 (moving up two points per day), the 3x1, the 4x1, the 8x1, and the 16x1. All of these different Gann angle lines combine to create the Gann Fan.\nFans are typically drawn from changes in trend or reversal points such as tops or bottoms and are a good way to measure a market's trend or strength. During an uptrend, if price stays in the space above an ascending angle without breaking below it, the market is considered bullish. During a downtrend, if price remains below a descending angle without breaking above it, the market is considered bearish.\nThe angle that is above or below current prices determines the perceived relative strength or weakness of the market. For example, if the price is above the 2x1 the market has shown itself to be much more bullish than if it is above the 1x1. Gann believed that when an uptrending price reverses and breaks under an ascending angle, the tendency of the price is to go to the next nearest angle below it. The opposite is also true. When a downtrending price reverses and breaks up through a descending angle, the tendency of the price is to go to the next nearest angle above it.\n\n\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\n\nNavigate to  https://www.tradingview.com/\nOn the landing page, enter a symbol and click \"Launch Chart\"\nDrawing Tools are located along the left hand side of the chart.

Users can manually draw and maneuver the four separate points (ABCD). The ABCD points create three separate legs which combine to form  chart patterns. The three legs are referred to as AB, BC, and CD.\nEach of the four points (ABCD) represent a significant high or low in terms of price on the chart. Therefore, the three previously mentioned legs (AB, BC, CD) represent different  trends  or price movements which move in opposite directions.\nAs a result there are three major ABCD chart patterns that are most common. These patterns can be either  bullish  or  bearish. It is important to note that it would be extremely rare for line lengths and ratios to ever be exactly equal.  Technical analysis  such as this is simply not an exact science. Because of this, some experimentation may be necessary.\nThe three major patterns include:\n\nAB=CD\nClassic ABCD\nABCD Extension\n\nAB=CD\nBoth the time and length of AB equal the time and length of CD.\nClassic ABCD\nCD should be either 127.2% or 161.8% of BC\nABCD Extension\nCD should be either 127.2% or 161.8% of AB\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\nStyle\n\nBorder\nCan change the color of the border as well as its thickness.\nText Options\nCan change the text color, font type and font size.

There is also a horizontal line which creates the base for the three shapes. The line is known as the neckline. This pattern can be both  bullish  as well as  bearish. For the example below, we will list the conditions of the Head & Shoulders Top which is the bearish setup. For the Head & Shoulders Bottom (bullish setup), the inverse of all of the following conditions is true.\n\n\nHead & Shoulders Top (Bearish)\n\nThe left shoulder forms at the end of an extensive advance in price. The move generally occurs during a period of high  volume. After the move up (peak), price declines to an extent to form a  valley.\nFrom the valley formed at the end of the left shoulder's formation, price then rises once again to a level that is higher than the peak of the left shoulder. This move is accompanied by either normal or high volume. Then, just like the left shoulder, price then reacts and falls again on low volume. The valley should be right around the same level as the previous valley formed at the end of the formation of the left shoulder.\nThe right shoulder then begins formation. The right shoulder in general is formed on lower volume than both the left shoulder and the head. The key aspect of the right shoulder is that its peak must be lower than the peak of the head.\nOnce both shoulders and the head are formed, the pattern is essentially complete. For the formation to be valid, a horizontal line known as the neckline should be able to cross through all three sections with the two valleys between the head and both shoulders resting on the line.\nNow that the Head & Shoulders pattern has been formed, all that's left is price confirmation. If price proceeds to fall below the neckline, this is considered to be confirmation of the bearish setup.\n\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\nStyle\n\nBorder\nCan change the color of the border as well as its thickness.\nText Options\nCan change the text color, font type and font size.

The pattern consists of a series of drives and retracements. There are five total points that make up a Three Drive formation. Three points (1, 2, 3) designate the end of the three drives which move along with the  trend. Two points (A, C) mark the ending points of two retracements which occur in between the drives. The idea behind the Three Drive setup is that at the conclusion of the third drive (which moves with the current  trend), price will then reverse in the opposite direction. The pattern, of course, can be either  bullish  or  bearish. The example below outlines the parameters of the bullish setup. The bearish setup would simply be the inverse of these conditions.\nBullish Three Drivers Pattern\n\nAlways remember that symmetry of both price and time are of extreme importance in this pattern's formation.\nDrives 2 and 3 should be specific extensions of the A and C retracements. The extensions should be 127.2% or 161.8%.\nThe A and C retracements will typically be either 61.8% or 78.6% of the previous swings. The possible exception is in strongly trending markets. If the market is trending strongly, these retracements may be only 38.2% or 50%.\nThe times (horizontal distances) of the A and C retracements should be as close to symmetrical as possible. The same is true for the extensions (the second and third drives to the bottom).\n\nIt is important to remember that this particular pattern is rare. This means that traders should not try to force the pattern onto the chart. If the formation contains  price gaps  or it is not symmetrical enough (slight variations are ok), it is best to abandon the formation and move on.\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\nStyle\n\nBorder\nCan change the color of the border as well as its thickness.\nText Options\nCan change the text color, font type and font size.

The Triangle Pattern drawing tool allows you to plot four points (A, B, C, D) in order to overlay a triangle onto the candlesticks of a price chart. The idea is to place the points on four alternating highs and lows. That is to say, points A and C would be on consecutive highs (or lows) and B and D would be then be on consecutive lows (or highs).\nThere are a few different types of triangle patterns to look for. The main differentiation between the types of triangles is the angle between the consecutive high points in relation to the angle between the consecutive low points. That is to say, what direction does the AC line move in when compared to the movement of the BD line?\nThe three types of triangles\n\nSymmetrical Triangle  - Characterized by the convergence of a  support line  and a  resistance line  into a point (the apex). In a symmetrical triangle the slopes of the two lines should be similar and as close to identical as possible. Price will then bounce between support and resistance before finally breaking out at the end. Generally speaking, the symmetrical triangle is regarded as a continuation pattern. This means that if the triangle is preceded by an  uptrend, when price finally breaks out, it will continue upwards. If preceded by a  downtrend, the opposite is true. Of course no rule in trading is always true. If price breaks out in the opposite direction of the previous trend, it should be considered the start of a new trend altogether.\n\nAscending Triangle  - A bullish triangle pattern characterized by the AC line forming a flat level of resistance and the BD line forming an ascending support line. Price will bounce back and forth between support and resistance levels before ultimately breaking out above the flat resistance line. There is also the possibility that price may break below the ascending support line therefore breaking the pattern. Because the breakout can be in the unexpected direction, it is usually advised to wait until breakout confirmation before entering a position. Trading in advance of a breakout can be dangerous.\n\nDescending Triangle  - A bearish triangle pattern characterized by the BD line forming a flat level of resistance and the AC line forming a descending support line. Price will bounce back and forth between support and resistance levels before ultimately breaking out below the flat resistance line. There is also the possibility that price may break above the descending support line therefore breaking the pattern. Because the breakout can be in the unexpected direction, it is usually advised to wait until breakout confirmation before entering a position. Trading in advance of a breakout can be dangerous.\n\n\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\nStyle\n\nBorder\nCan change the color of the border as well as its thickness.\nText Options\nCan change the text color, font type and font size.

Users can manually draw and maneuver the five separate points (XABCD). The XABCD points create four separate legs which combine to form  chart patterns. The four legs are referred to as XA, AB, BC, and CD.\nEach of the five points (XABCD) represent a significant high or low in terms of price on the chart. Therefore, the four previously mentioned legs (XA, AB, BC, CD) represent different  trendsor price movements which move in opposite directions.\nAs a result there are four major XABCD chart patterns that are most common. These patterns can be either  bullish  or  bearish.\nThe four major patterns include:\n\nGartley\nButterfly\nCrab\nBat\n\nGartley\nFor this example we will examine a Bullish Gartley Pattern\n\nThe pattern begins with an uptrend designated as XA\nPrice reverses back down at A and stops at B. The Fibonacci Retracement ration of AB should be 61.8% of the price range of A minus X.\nPrice reverses at B. The BC retracement should be between 61.8% and 78.6% of the AB price range (not the length of the lines). This is shown along the line AC.\nAt C, price reverses with retracement CD between 127% and 161.8% of the range BC. This is shown along the line BD.\nPrice D is the point to enter the market (buy).\n\nButterfly\nFor this example we will examine a Bullish Butterfly Pattern\n\nThe swing from A to D should be a 127.2% or 161.8% extension of the XA line\nWithin the A to D swing, a valid ABCD pattern must be observed.\nIn an ideal setup, the two triangles (XAB and BCD) should be almost equal in terms of time. If not look for the second triangle (BCD) to be between 61.8% and 161.8% of the first triangle (XAB).\nA move beyond 161.8% would suggest that the bullish pattern is broken and bearish movement may be inevitable.\n\nCrab\n\nAB should be the 0.382 or 0.618 retracement of the XA line.\nBC should be either the 0.382 or 0.886 retracement of the AB line.\nCD is the 2.24 or 9.64 extension of the BC line.\n\nBat\n\nAB is the 0.382 or 0.500 retracement of the XA line.\nBC is the 0.382 or 0.886 retracement of the AB line.\nCD can be either the 1.618 or 2.618 extension of the BC line.\n\nHOW TO USE IN TRADINGVIEW\nStyle\n\nBorder\nCan change the color of the border as well as its thickness.\nText Options\nCan change the text color, font type and font size.
